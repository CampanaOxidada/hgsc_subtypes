# SUMMARY
#######################
The repository contains instructions to replicate the analysis of identifying high-grade serous ovarian cancer subtypes across Australian, American, and Japanese populations. We leverage data from a variety of studies extracted from the bioconductor package curatedOvarianData (Ganzfried et al. 2013) as well as a dataset we uploaded to GEO (GSE74357). We apply a unified, unsupervised bioinformatics pipeline to compare subtypes across these populations and determine that specific subtypes are reliably identified. The most replicable subtypes were mesenchymal-like and proliferative-like and their sample representation was highly concordant with other independent clustering studies performed on single populations.

# ANALYSIS
#######################
For ease of use and to ensure reproducibility, all analyses should be performed in our Docker image <https://hub.docker.com/r/gregway/hgsc_subtypes/>
To install docker, please follow the friendly instructions provided here: <https://docs.docker.com/linux/>

After installing Docker, install our docker image
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
$docker pull gregway/hgsc_subtypes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Clone this github repository and run docker to perform analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
$git clone https://github.com/greenelab/hgsc_subtypes.git
$docker run -d -v ~/<PATH>/hgsc_subtypes/:/hgsc_subtypes/ -p 5000:80 -i gregway/hgsc_subtypes sh hgsc_subtypes/docker/docker_command.sh
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Where PATH is the directory structure where the github repo is cloned. Note, runtime is on the order of several hours.
